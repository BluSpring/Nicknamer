# To-do List (for maintainers/contributors)
- Implement PronounDB support (maybe)
- Add support for separate nickname and pronouns on different servers
  - There should be an import command for all the things if needed, but also make it
    in a way that doesn't reveal IPs and such.
- ~~Add the ability to get info of the players who are offline.~~
